# Comunitree - WIP

A lot of us tried new hobbies during the COVID lockdowns, like baking or cycling.

I decided to grow my own fruit and veg. 

However, the waiting list for an allotment in a lot of UK cities ranges from 2 years to 20 years depending on location and popularity. So I started working on AirBNB / FB Marketplace-esque garden sharing platform whereby you could list a garden you weren't making use of and local gardeners could use it in exchange for fresh veg / friendship / gratitude etc. 

I used this as an opportunity to try out and learn Relay / Relay Hooks so it's a bit messy, but I plan to transition to Apollo in future.
